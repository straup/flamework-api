Hey, wait a second! You've already approved this application's request to access your account. However, the application still hasn't completed the authorization process on their end.

We apologize for the inconvenience but as a precaution we're not going to go any further. In case you're wondering about the details: The requested permissions – the <code>scope</code> – are missing or look funny.
