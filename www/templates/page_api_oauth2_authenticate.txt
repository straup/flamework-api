Hey, wait a second! You've already approved this application's request to access your account. However, the application still hasn't completed the authorization process on their end. We apologize for any inconvenience but we're not going to go any further just in case there's some funny business going on.

If you're seeing this it means that the {$key.app_title|escape} application forgot to include some data (or sent incorrect data) as part of their authorization request. We apologize for the inconvenience but as a precaution we're not going to go any further. In case you're wondering about the details: The requested permissions – the <code>scope</code> – are missing or look funny.
